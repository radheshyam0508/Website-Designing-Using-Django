      These services are meant to do a detail analytic analysis of Next Generation Sequencing and Microarray data. With the help of effective computational methods and algorithms we can understand the specific mechanism and complexity of cellular responses with a prime focus on genomic, transcriptomics and proteomics applications.
       </br></br>
      High-throughput technologies of DNA/RNA sequencing has led to understand the complexity of physical and biological sciences. These data generated from latest innovation like, next generation approaches (NGS) has triggered a revolution, and have brought forth many challenges for meaningful data analysis and understanding of human health and disease. </br></br>
      Motto of our firm is to linearized the research complexity, according to the objective of a scientific groups and provides detailed graphical and interactive output.  We provide solutions of problems like, IoT, Machine learning, Deep learning apprroaches approaches Genome Assembly of all type of NGS data (Genomics and Transcriptomics), Gene Finding and Annotation, Marker Data Analysis (SSR, SNP etc.), Comparative Genomics, Prediction of Environmental Data (Air and Water Pollutions)
